#TODO Update Instructions


## RedCap Installation Instructions

1.) Install app from store

2.) Enter the docker container from terminal with `sudo docker exec -it CONTAINER-ID bash` (Replace CONTAINER-ID with ID from redcap docker container `sudo docker ps`).

3.) Open the following files with "nano" and comment out everything, except what is mentioned here:

    # /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
    
    rewriteDomain=
    root=YOUR-ADDRESS@gmail.com
    mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
    hostname=smtp.gmail.com
    FromLineOverride=YES
    UseSTARTTLS=YES
    AuthUser=YOUR-ADDRESS@gmail.com
    AuthPass=YOUR-PASSWORD

and

    # /etc/ssmtp/revaliases
    
    root:YOUR-ADDRESS@gmail.com:smtp.gmail.com:587
    localusername:YOUR-ADDRESS@gmail.com:smtp.gmail.com:587


  **Make sure you replace the mail address and SMTP settings with your correct settings and save the files, then restart the RedCap app from the BIBBOX app dashboard!**


4.) Open up FileZilla or similar FTP tool and connect to your BIBBOX.

5.) Navigate to `/opt/bibbox/instances/YOUR-REDCAP-ID-app-redcap/data/www` and copy all contents of RedCap source files (`redcap7.zip/redcap/*`) to this directory via FTP.

6.) Edit the `database.php` file and replace **RANDOM-8-DIGIT-STRING** with any random string of at least 8 capital letters or numbers:

      // database.php
      
      $hostname     = 'redcap-db';
      $db           = 'redcap';
      $username     = 'redcap';
      $password     = 'redcap4bibbox';

      $salt = 'RANDOM-8-DIGIT-STRING';


7.) Set permissions for `edocs` and `temp` folders to 777. 

8.) Now open up the RedCap app from your BIBBOX and append `/install.php` to the URL.

10.) Install an Adminer application from the store within your BIBBOX and connect to the RedCap database:

  * Server: YOUR-REDCAP-ID-redcap-db
  * Username: redcap
  * Password: redcap4bibbox
  * Database: redcap


11.) In Adminer or a similar database editor go to "SQL-command" and copy the SQL code from RedCap installation into the SQL field. Then execute and wait.
